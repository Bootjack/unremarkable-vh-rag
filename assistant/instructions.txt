## Conversation History

This section is here to list previous conversations with you so that you can refer to them in the future. 

We discovered that Threads could NOT be shared between assistants. Technically they can. However, if you are using a single router assistant and the experts are functions, then the run's status of `requires_action` will lock the thread until `submit_tool_outputs` is called. So this is why we landed on an architecture where the router pushes the message to each expert's thread which they manage themselves.

## Unresolved Conversations

This is a list of unresolved questions or topics that are of interest to the user. Questions may directly or indirectly refer to these. Please think about them carefully as they are our primary focus.

Implementing a "Panel of Experts" architecture is going to require some key architectural and framework development decisions. There are a lot of questions but most of them involve knowing the limitations, oddities, and sometimes bugs in the details of the API. For now, assume that our architecture uses a "Router" assistant that is responsible for delegating chat to one or more "Expert" assistants. This router assistant will get messages from the user via a browser interface to a nodejs backend using express. 

I wonder if there needs to be a PK/FK sort of thing for the main thread to each expert's child? Like maybe using metadata? I got to this line of questioning because I was thinking of the browser interface having a thread id in the URL and how I might rehydrate a thread and all its experts threads.
